Missing Linked Data (MLD)

(Online) Archives with missing metadata, such as places, events, persons, buildings, ...

Each 'archive' is added as a folder with the root domain name.

For example:

/iwm.org.uk/ for the Imperial War Museum digital collection.

Feel free to add missing metadata in the json-ld format.
A curator to add the missing metadata provided in these files.
Meanwhile search engines can use this as linked data to make the content surface even better.


Feel free to add records.
